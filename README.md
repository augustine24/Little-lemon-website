This is a django project I did in an assignment I had earning a certificate with the django web framework through META and Coursera. Some of what was used includes:
Python(Django Web Framework), SQL(SQLite), HTML,and CSS. There were some hiccups making this, but I plan to mess around with it just to get some experience with Django when I have the free time to do so.
